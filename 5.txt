we can proceed with building our own crawler. It’s known that Python is an open-source programming language, and you can find many useful functional libraries.
Here, I suggest the BeautifulSoup (Python Library) for the reason that it is easier to work with and possesses many intuitive characters. More exactly, I will utilize two Python modules to crawl the data.

BeautifulSoup does not fetch the web page for us. That’s why I use urllib2 to combine with the BeautifulSoup library. Then, we need to deal with HTML tags to find all the links within the page’s <a> tags and the right table. 
After that, iterate through each row (tr) and then assign each element of tr (td) to a variable and append it to a list. Let’s first look at the HTML structure of the table (I am not going to extract information for table heading <the>).


Pros of Building Your Own Crawler

The customized crawler with the whole process within your control
Proxies available for preventing the crawler from being blocked by some websites
Friendly to people with coding skills
 

Cons of Building Your Own Crawler

Time-consuming to crawl a website on your own by programming
Unfriendly to people without any coding skills (Alternatively, the no-coders can hire a freelance web scraping developer. 
But both learning to program and hiring some professional people are approaches adding overheads to the data collection operations)
